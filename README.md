# A project testing Parallelism, with algorithms such as:
### Kmeans, 
### The game of life, 

#### and others with many different settings for how many cores would run the algorithm each time, and other settings changing such as timeout. 

#### Testing on GPUs, CPUs, and graphs, all visible within the main report which is uploaded here as a PDF file, available for download so that its hyperlinks work.
